While I've started my career with big businesses such as SAP and RIM I've quickly gravitated towards start-ups where my ability to adapt and take on whatever technical challenges laid ahead could make a real difference. Currently my focus is on <strong>Ruby on Rails and iOS Applications</strong> but my experience spans a wide range of technologies, languagues and platforms. My <i>fort√©</i> is taking a concept from idea to a fully working web/mobile product, sometimes with little to no external help. </p> <p> In some cases, I've been able to get V1 of a product to market by myself and then build an agile team to move the product forward in an attempt to gain customers and market share. In other cases, I've had to put months and months of work into a project only to realise that the concept doesn't have a product/market fit and would require a fundamental concept shift to work, if at all. In all cases, the market teaches you to pay attention to what you are doing. You just have to be ready to listen. </p> <p> As a result, my programming has evolved over time from <strong>cowboy style</strong> - <i>let's try to build this or let's try to build that</i> - to what I like to call <strong>samurai style</strong> - <i>take 1 shot and make it count.</i> Start-ups are not all about success and fun. Not most of them anyway, but you do learn a lot of other things along the way. One thing I've learned is that my motivation to develop and deliver beautiful software is pure and I am sure I'll be doing this for a long time regardless of successes or failures that may come along the way. </p> <p> Get in touch if you think that I can help. While I am very selective about the projects I spend my time on now I am always open to giving and receiving feedback. </p> <a class='email-me button' href='mailto:dima.berastau@gmail.com' id=contact> <i class='fa fa-2x fa-envelope'></i> </a> </div> </li> <li> <div class='timeline-badge work'> <i class='fa fa-briefcase'></i> </div> <div class=timeline-panel> <div class=timeline-heading> <h4>CTO, Karmasoft</h4> <p> <small class=text-muted> <i class='fa fa-calendar-o'></i> Apr 2012 - Current </small> </p> </div> <div class=timeline-body> <p> Karmasoft is a complete yoga studio management software.
